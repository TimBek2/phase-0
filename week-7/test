Ch. 0: Introduction (Links to an external site.)
	Did you learn anything new about JavaScript or programming in general?
	I learned that JavaScript has no relation at all to Java. I knew they weren't similar in what they do, but I thought maybe they shared a parent company or something. 

	Are there any concepts you feel uncomfortable with?
	Nothing so far. I'm anxious to start working in JavaScript, I've heard it can be hard to work with, but it makes sense at this point. 

Ch. 1: Values, Types, and Operators (Links to an external site.)
	Identify two similarities and two differences between JavaScript and Ruby syntax with regard to numbers, arithmetic, strings, booleans, and various operators.
	Similarities:
		1. Both of these languages have the same arithmetic operators + - * / %
		2. They both have some form of dot notation for calling operatorors/methods on objects. 
	Differences:
		1. In Ruby, you can have floats or integers. In JS, all numbers/arithmetic are floats by default, and you must use a method like .floor to explicitly make it an integer. 
		2. Ruby ends most code blocks with end, while Javascript uses semicolons to end each statement. They're not used exactly the same way, but they're the most common statement-ending pieces. 

Ch. 2: Program Structure (Links to an external site.)
	What is an expression?
	A fraction of code that produces a value.

	What is the purpose of semicolons in JavaScript? Are they always required?
	The semicolon indicates the end of a statement. They're not always required, but usually are. 

	What causes a variable to return undefined?
	If you call a variable that has not had a value given to it yet. 

	Write your own variable and do something to it in the eloquent.js file.
	Done.

	What does console.log do and when would you use it? What Ruby method(s) is this similar to?
	console.log prints the result of a statement to the console. This is similar to puts or print. 

	Write a short program that asks for a user to input their favorite food. After they hit return, have the program respond with "Hey! That's my favorite too!" (You will probably need to run this in the Chrome console (Links to an external site.) rather than node since node does not support prompt or alert). Paste your program into the eloquent.js file.

	var favfood = prompt("What\'s your favorite food?", "")
	alert("Hey! That's my favorite too!")

	Describe while and for loops
	While loops create a loop at that point and continue to execute a block until it doesn't apply anymore. If there are multiple statements within the loop, it is wrapped in curly braces. 
	For loops are like while loops, but they're condensed even further, into just one line. It allows a familiar shorthand to common statements. 

	What other similarities or differences between Ruby and JavaScript did you notice in this section?
	A lot of the math-based logic gates are the same, it's just some syntax and grammar that is different. Eg JavaScript needs semicolons after every statement while Ruby doesn't, but they both still use if and else statements similarly. Also, they both indent code to help the programmer keep track of blocks. 

	Complete at least one of the exercises (Looping a Triangle, FizzBuzz, of Chess Board) in the eloquent.js file.


Ch. 3: Functions (Links to an external site.) (Skip the sections on closure and recursion)
	What are the differences between local and global variables in JavaScript?
	Local variables are defined within a function and are scoped only within that function, just like with Ruby. Global variables, however, have to be called outside of a definition and aren't identified with a marker (@ in Ruby), so you can't call them within function definitions either. 

	When should you use functions?
	Functions are used to perform actions on data passed in, usually stored in variables. There are generally 2 times you need to write a function: 1) If you write the same code over and over again, you should write a function to automate that reptitive process. 2) The other time is if you need some functionality that doesn't exist, and it basically sounds like it needs a function of its own. 

	What is a function declaration?
	Function declaration is an alternative notation that lets you define a function as long as it starts the line, so you don't have to write out var fun = function...

	Complete the minimum exercise in the eloquent.js file.


Ch. 4: Data Structures: Objects and Arrays (Links to an external site.) 
	Skip the sections on the Lycanthrope's log, Computing Correlations, and sections from Further Arrayology to the Global Object, but read the chapter summary.

	What is the difference between using a dot and a bracket to look up a property? Ex. array.max vs array["max"]
	Using a dot means that you are accessing a value stored in a variable, and it must be a valid variable name. Bracket on the other hand tries to evaluate the expression within the bracket, and then uses the result of the evaluation as the property name. 

	Create an object called me that stores your name, age, three favorite foods, and a quirk in your eloquent.js file.
	Done

	What is a JavaScript object with a name and value property similar to in Ruby?
	It's similar to a Hash. 

Reflection:

	What are the biggest similarities and differences between JavaScript and Ruby?
	They share a lot of the same built in functions, or are present with similar names, but I feel like there's more universality between object types within Ruby vs JS (for example, .reverse works on Strings as well in Ruby, but you can only use it on an Array in JavaScript). From what I can tell so far, they have all of the same built in object classes, but I haven't explored too much in JavaScript yet. 

	Was some of your Ruby knowledge solidified by learning another language? If so, which concepts?
	When I was doing some things wrong in JavaScript (trying to do things like I would in Ruby), I started realizing how much better I was at understanding how the logic would work and what existed at each point in the code within Ruby, and it was confusing me in JavaScript. 

	How do you feel about diving into JavaScript after reading these chapters?
	I'm excited to dive into it. I know it's very powerful and versatile, and a lot of people come to love it once they've become more comfortable with it.
