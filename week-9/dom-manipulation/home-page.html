<!-- Reflection

What did you learn about the DOM?
The DOM isn't a language or software interface - it's a standard for how documents and objects should be laid out and how they should behave on webpages (HTML, XHTML, XML files). As such, it's not exclusively a JavaScript utility, although it is most commonly used to manipulate HTML and CSS elements with JavaScript code. 
This is the tool that allows pages to become more interactive and have interactive features like embedded maps on the page, as well as cosmetic things like more effects when hovering over a box or when clicking a button. 

What are some useful methods to use to manipulate the DOM? 
getElementById is very important, along with getElementsByTagName and getElementsByClassName. We also used .appendChild to add new content to the site, which could be very useful for having information that's hidden in a drop down or expanding box, that only shows up after clicking on a button, but it may turn out that there's another way to better implement this function.
