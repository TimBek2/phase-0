How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements? 
Chrome Devtools allows you to inspect the html and css code of a site, and even make alterations to it, and they'll be displayed as you make them, without altering the original file at all. You can experiment with different ideas for how you want to style your page, and DevTools will also do things like highlight the entire element and display the margin, so you can get a detailed visualization of how your page will be shown. 

How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
Elements can be resized by giving them height and width properties within DevTools. They can be sized in px (pixels), em (dynamic amountrelative to default font size, useful for styling for both computers and smartphones), or by giving a percentage to the height or width properties, in which case it will fill that percentage of the screen.

What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
Static - No special formatting, the object displays in order.
Relative - The object will be positioned relative to its normal (static) position. By using top, right, bottom, or left features, it can be moved away from its normal position. Any changes to the top, right, bottom, or left will move it away from its normal position.
Fixed - The object will remain positioned within the browser window where it is (such as floating at the top).
Absolute - The object will position itself relative to its first first positioned ancestor. 
Static and Absolute positions were the hardest for me, static because paying attention to things like traits of the ancestors was something that I forgot to do a lot, and absolute similarly because it is more influenced by its parents, and that's just something that I forgot to do.

What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?
These are the three parts of the box model. The padding surrounds the content itself, and changes to this will change how the content is laid out on the page. A border goes around the padding and the content, and separates the element from the rest of the page. The margin defines the space around an element, and will create blank space around elements if changed.

What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
This challenge was a fun one. It was much easier to play around with the features after we had learned it, and likewise screenshots is an easy and familiar medium (relative to the rest of the things we've been doing), so it was less uncomfortable.
