# Numbers to Commas Solo Challenge

# I spent [] hours on this challenge.

# Complete each step below according to the challenge directions and
# include it in this file. Also make sure everything that isn't code
# is commented in the file.

# 0. Pseudocode

# What is the input? A positive integer
# What is the output? (i.e. What should the code return?) A string that contains the integer with separating commas if necessary - 1000 => 1,000
# What are the steps needed to solve the problem? 
# Take the number, convert it to a string
# Place a comma at every 3rd digit, starting from the right
# Maybe that's done by dividing it into arrays of thousands-groups,
# and then returning those separated with a comma
# 
# 1. Initial Solution
def separate_comma()
	



# 2. Refactored Solution




# 3. Reflection
