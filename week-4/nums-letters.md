What does puts do?
Puts literally writes to the screen whatever comes after it. It doesn't return any result back into the program, just writes it to the screen.

What is an integer? What is a float?
An interger is any whole number, that is it doesn't have a decimal point. A float, or floating-point number, is any number that does have a decimal point.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?
Float division is like long division, you would continue the problem even if you have an answer that isn't a whole number (9/2=4.5). Interger division, on the other hand, never has a decimal point, and that decimal is always rounded down (9/2=4, because we round down the .5 with interger division).

Mini-challenges:

```ruby
# number of hours in a year
p 24 * 365
# minutes in a decade...
puts 60 * 24 * 365 * 10
#my age in seconds
print 1025000000 / 31557600
```
