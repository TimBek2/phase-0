<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
- It was surprising in how easy it was after it was done, but when I was first looking at it, I had no idea where to start. My partner was much more comfortable working in HTML than I was, and she was super helpful in explaining what I was doing wrong and why it broke that way. 
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
- It was generally good, there is an incredible amount of information on HTML available so it was easy for me to get sidetracked or start going down a rabbit hole and wasting time. 
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
- I think we did awesome at it. We used a <strong> tag up top for some bolded text up top as a proof on concept, and otherwise it's all just plain text. 
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
- The syntax is way more computer-y (or at least distant from English) at first look, so it seems harder to use, although it's also incredibly powerful because of how versatile all those tags are
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
- Remember to close your tags right when you open them if that isn't done automatically, and remember not to put a leading / for file paths.
