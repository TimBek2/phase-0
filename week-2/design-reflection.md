*What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
1. Information Gathering - This is when you identify purpose of the projects, goals, target audience, and choose what type/medium of content you want to have. You want to ask questions critically and consider what you envision the end product to be in essence, since details are likely to change. 
2. Planning - You create an outline for the website - a site map for the structure of the pages, starting with filler for content but begin to add categories and ideas for what should go into it. Consider platforms you want to use early such as WordPress
3. Design - The design process involves the entire production of the site, from creating wireframes and style guides for colors, font, and general feel of the site. You should begin with images of example pages and might be given access to private, semi-working beta pages throughout the process to refine the functionality of the product as it is built.
4. Development - Development is when the website is actually built. The various prototype products will be used to create the final product. First a home page is built, then a shell containing a skeleton navigation system and all of the pages that are to exist. Each of these pages are then built out, forms and interactive elements of the site are created and tested, and things like CMS systems are installed. These design stages should be visible to others within the company for review and further testing of the functionality. 
5. Testing and Delivery - During T&D, the final touches are implemented and you should be checking your code to ensure that it validates (is up to current development standards). Plugins will also be fully implemented at this point, and other details can be optimized, such as metadata for SEO purposes.
6. Maintenance - Maintainance includes upkeep on the site after it is constructed. This could include redesigns and fixes to the navigation/UX after it's been released to the masses, or just creating more content to populate the site as time goes on. 

*What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site primarily serves as a central hub to my body of work. I will be hosting my code projects (will this just be links to github or the code itself, maybe embedded? I don't know), but it will also have contact information and details about myself to provide more of a picture than just a resume.

*What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
Their primary common interest is going to be in me as a developer, which I'm going to address by having examples of my code and references when I have those too. Most employers are also interested in the person as well, so I plan on including some more personal details to help fill in the blanks about what kind of a person I am to work with and interact with daily. 

*What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
My main action path (story?) would be for someone to see my portfolio and then contact me with a job. I haven't really come up with other information I have on the site, so other actions may come into play later, but for now I want to focus on seeing my work and then contacting me if they want to.

*What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
What you like doesn't matter, you need to keep your audience in mind and design exclusively for them, and remember that the work isn't done when the website goes live. 

*What is user experience design and why is it valuable? 
User experience design is the practice of designing a website with the user experience being the foremost consideration - how easy is it to use, to navigate, is it aesthetically pleasing, etc. It's valuable because it makes the focus of the product design be on the end user, rather than on the creator. It leads to cleaner and more usable sites, which in turn gives better performance when users don't bounce away or leave before they've finished all of the actions that you want them to do.

*Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
It's still unclear to me what we're doing with the image of the site map. I know that they are text files normally, in the familiar tree design, hosted in the root directory of a site. When the instructions say to draw it on paper (or buy a product), then suddenly the next step is "take the file from your computer" without ever saying to take a picture and get it on your computer or something like that, I thought I had missed something. You should just make the instructions be for everybody to draw a picture and use their phone to put it onto their computer, and then at the end of the challenge say "you can also use programs like Writemaps to make image-based sitemaps easily. You should make it clear that there's no need to pay for a product though, since there are free HTML and XML sitemap generators that make a usable sitemap, so these are basically just subscription based nice interfaces.
