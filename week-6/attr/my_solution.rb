What are these methods doing?
All of the what_is_ methods simply return the values associated with each variable, and the change_my_ methods allow you to assign a new value to each variable. 

How are they modifying or returning the value of instance variables?
Because it is an instance variable denoted with @, it exists within the entire class object. What_is methods just return the value, while change_my methods take and argument and set the variable equal to that.
